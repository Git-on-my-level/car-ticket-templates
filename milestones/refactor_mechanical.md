title: "Refactor (mechanical): [FILL_ME]"
goal: "Improve structure/readability without changing behavior"
---

> Template note: Use for mechanical refactors (rename, move files, simplify structure). Avoid behavior changes.

## Scope (fill in)
- What is being refactored: [FILL_ME]
- What is explicitly NOT changing (behavior guarantees): [FILL_ME]

## Context to load
- Relevant modules: [FILL_ME]
- Existing tests/lint setup: [FILL_ME]

## Rules
- Keep diffs small and reviewable.
- Do not mix mechanical refactor with feature changes.
- If you discover needed behavior changes, pause and propose a new ticket.

## Tasks
- [ ] Perform the mechanical refactor:
  - [ ] [FILL_ME step]
  - [ ] [FILL_ME step]
- [ ] Update imports/exports and any references.
- [ ] Update docs/comments if paths/names changed.

## Verification
- [ ] Run: [FILL_ME commands]
- [ ] Confirm behavior unchanged (brief justification).

## Stop conditions (pause)
- [ ] A behavior change seems required to complete the refactor cleanly
- [ ] Tests cannot be run
