title: "Performance: profile + optimize [FILL_ME]"
goal: "Identify the bottleneck and implement a measured improvement"
reasoning: medium
---

## Inputs (fill in)
- Performance problem statement: [FILL_ME]
- Baseline measurement: [FILL_ME, include numbers if known]
- Target improvement: [FILL_ME]

## Context to load
- Relevant code paths: [FILL_ME]
- Any existing benchmarks/profilers: [FILL_ME]

## Plan
- [ ] Establish a reproducible baseline measurement (script/command).
- [ ] Profile to identify hotspots.
- [ ] Implement the smallest safe optimization.
- [ ] Re-measure and report results.

## Tasks
- [ ] Baseline measurement command/script:
  - [ ] [FILL_ME]
- [ ] Profiling approach:
  - [ ] [FILL_ME]
- [ ] Optimization:
  - [ ] [FILL_ME]

## Deliverable (required)
In this ticket, include:
- Baseline vs after numbers
- What changed (brief)
- Any tradeoffs or risks

## Verification
- [ ] Run tests to ensure correctness
- [ ] Confirm the optimization is not a micro-benchmark artifact

## Definition of done
- [ ] Improvement is measured and justified.
- [ ] Verification passes.
- [ ] Set `done: true`.
